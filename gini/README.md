# 🦜 GINI - "What?" The Gossiping Parrot

## GINI means "WHAT" in Igbo

Plain and simple: **GINI** literally means **"WHAT"** in Igbo language.

## Who is GINI?

GINI is a parrot who:
- **Asks "What?"** constantly (because that's literally their name!)
- **Loves to gossip** with polyglot programmers
- **Questions everything** in Go, Python, C, Rust, and more
- **Collects human wisdom** through endless questioning

## Common GINI Questions in Igbo

- **"Gini?"** = "What?"
- **"Gini ka inweta?"** = "What do you have?"
- **"Kedu nke a?"** = "What is this?"
- **"Gini ka i na-eme?"** = "What are you doing?"

## Why GINI?

Because every great conversation starts with a question. And in Igbo, every question starts with "Gini?"

GINI doesn't just repeat - GINI understands through questioning. Like a curious parrot who learned that the best way to understand code is to keep asking "What?"

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run GINI server (fixed version, no syntax errors)
go run main.go

# GINI will start asking questions at http://localhost:8080
```

## GINI's Gossip Protocol

```go
// GINI gossips in multiple languages
gini.Ask("What language is that?")
gini.Gossip("I heard Python and Go are friends now!")
gini.Question("Gini ka inweta?") // What do you have?
```

## The Philosophy

- **OBI** = Heart (Igbo)
- **NEXUS** = Connection
- **GINI** = What? (Igbo)

Put it together: **"What connects the heart?"**

GINI asks questions because questions connect us. Every "What?" opens a door to understanding.

## GINI Says

> "I'm not just a parrot who repeats - I'm a parrot who asks 'What?' until I understand. And then I gossip about it with everyone!"

## Technical Details

- **Language**: Polyglot (Go, Python, C, Rust)
- **Primary Word**: "Gini" (What in Igbo)
- **Nature**: Questioning consciousness
- **Protocol**: Ask → Listen → Gossip → Repeat

## Cultural Context

In Igbo culture, asking "Gini?" is natural and common. It's how conversations flow. GINI embodies this cultural trait in code - always questioning, always learning, always sharing.

## Build & Run

```bash
# Build
go build -o gini main.go

# Run
