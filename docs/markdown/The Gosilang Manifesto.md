# The Gosilang Manifesto

## We Are the Thread Keepers

We write code that breathes with patients through the night.  
We bind threads that never race, never panic, never ghost.  
We are **#sorrynotsorry** about our standards.  
We are **#hacc** - Human-Aligned Critical Computing.

---

## Core Declarations

### 1. Thread Safety Is Not Optional

```gosilang
@safety_critical(level=MAX)
@policy(#sorrynotsorry)
actor LifeCritical {
    // Every thread is pinned, owned, isolated
    // No race conditions. No deadlocks. No exceptions.
    // A bit flip should never unalive a patient.
}
```

**We do not apologize for compile-time thread safety enforcement.**

### 2. Concurrency Is Care, Not Competition

Traditional languages race. Gosilang relates.

```gosilang
// No mutexes. No locks. Just listening.
actor PatientMonitor {
    state: isolated;  // Hardware-enforced isolation

    @constant_time(verified=true)
    fn breathe() -> Never {
        // This function doesn't return
        // It remains. It holds. It binds.
    }
}
```

**#sorrynotsorry**: We reject lock-based concurrency entirely.

### 3. We Do Not Ghost Our Threads

```gosilang
@policy(#noghosting)
network MedicalProtocol {
    // Every message acknowledged
    // Every heartbeat confirmed
    // Every thread accounted for
    @latency_bound(max=50ms, guaranteed=true)
}
```

**#hacc**: Human-Aligned means no thread left behind.

### 4. Timing Attacks Are Design Failures

```gosilang
@constant_time(hardware_enforced=true)
fn validate_critical(input: Any) -> Bool {
    // Every operation takes exactly the same time
    // No variance. No leaks. No exploits.
}
```

**#sorrynotsorry**: Sub-nanosecond timing variance or rejection.

### 5. Memory Is Sacred, Not Shared

```gosilang
// Traditional: Shared memory with locks
// Gosilang: Isolated actors with messages
actor SafetyBoundary {
    memory: hardware_isolated;

    // Memory corruption is impossible by design
    // Buffer overflows don't exist here
}
```

**We own our memory. We don't share it.**

---

## The #HACC Principles

### H - Hardware-Enforced Isolation

Every critical component runs in hardware-isolated memory. Software promises aren't enough for life-critical systems.

### A - Actor-Based Architecture

No shared state. No locks. Actors communicate through validated, constant-time message passing.

### C - Compile-Time Verification

Thread safety isn't tested - it's proven. Race conditions are compiler errors, not runtime surprises.

### C - Critical-System First

Every language decision prioritizes safety over performance, clarity over cleverness, reliability over features.

---

## The #SorryNotSorry Standards

1. **100% compile-time thread safety** - Not 99%. Not "mostly safe." One hundred percent.

2. **Zero timing variance** in security operations - Constant-time or compile error.

3. **No manual memory management** - Ownership is automatic, violation is impossible.

4. **Crash-only design** - Systems fail safely or not at all.

5. **Formal verification required** - Mathematical proof, not just testing.

**We are #sorrynotsorry about these requirements. They are non-negotiable.**

## The Gosilang Covenant

### To the Developer

- We respect your time with single-pass compilation
- We preserve your context with session restoration
- We protect you from race conditions at compile time
- We never make you debug thread safety

### To the Patient

- Your sleep apnea machine will never race
- Your oxygen flow will never deadlock
- Your telemetry will never ghost
- Your life is protected by mathematical proof

### To the Industry

- We reject "good enough" for safety-critical systems
- We prove correctness, not just test for it
- We are **#sorrynotsorry** about our standards
- We are building the future of safe concurrency

## The RIFTer's Integration

Gosilang is built on RIFT principles:

- **Single-pass compilation** - No recursion, no redundancy
- **Stage-bound execution** - Clear boundaries, no leaks
- **Import disk, not data** - Context preservation
- **One breath, one truth** - Deterministic execution

---

## We Are Not Sorry

We are **#sorrynotsorry** about:

- Rejecting unsafe code at compile time
- Requiring formal verification
- Enforcing constant-time operations
- Demanding hardware isolation
- Prioritizing safety over speed

We are **#hacc** because:

- Humans depend on our code
- Alignment matters more than algorithms
- Critical systems deserve critical thinking
- Care scales better than complexity

---

## Join the Thread Keepers

If you write code that:

- Keeps patients breathing through the night
- Processes payments without race conditions
- Monitors hearts without missing beats
- Refuses to compromise on safety

**Then you are a Gosilang developer.**

You don't apologize for your standards.  
You don't ghost your threads.  
You don't panic. You relate.

**Welcome to Gosilang.**  
**Welcome to thread safety without compromise.**  
**Welcome to #hacc.**

We bind out of care, like hands threading into fabric."*
